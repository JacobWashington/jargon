# jargon

## Description

One of the greatest challenges Veterans face when breaking into tech is envisioning themselves within the industry. Coming from a notoriously ridged culture, veterans are often intimidated by the seemingly relaxed atmosphere present in tech. With fears and insecurities swarming, sometimes it helps to find others who speak the **jargon**. 

**jargon** is a networking and employment oriented application that connects veterans in tech to colleagues and peers, mentors and employers, training resources, and job opportunities. By creating a networking community of vets in tech, **jargon** breaks down the barriers of entry many veterans face, and narrows the market for veterans seeking careers and connections within the industry.
